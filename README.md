# Deep_learning_fMRI
Implementation of deep learning models in decoding fMRI data in a context of semantic processing


# Goal:
1. To illustrate basic concepts of deep neural network models (DNN and CNN implementation so far) \surd
2. To illustrate how to utilize deep neural network models to decode fMRI data
3. To illustrate principle ways of cross-validating the deep neural network models
4. To illustrate how upsupervised learning model is more straightforward to implement in deep neural network models than scit-kit learning implementation
5. To Propose a way to visualize the learned latent representations of the unsupervised models
6. To show how the literature has been using the deep neural network models in classification
7. To demonstrate how deep neural network models can decode conscious states
